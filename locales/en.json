            "answer": "Generally, it is accepted to use Windster in open-source projects, as long as it is not a UI library, a theme, a template, a page-builder that would be considered as an alternative to Windster itself. With that being said, feel free to use this design kit for your open-source projects. Find out more information by reading the license."
